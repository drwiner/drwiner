### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning engineer and full stack developer interested in Machine Learning product development and R&D, applying research background in natural language processing, automated planning, and human-computer interaction to product architecture, development.

Currently, I develop state-of-the-art AI models at conversational AI market leader Kasisto (since 2018) that transform previously unused data into new competitive edges for the company, and I manage multiple projects for integrating models into our platform so they are production-ready.
